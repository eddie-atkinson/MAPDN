The folders in this directory will contain JSON files for the buses, lines, loads, and linecodes for any of the networks processed.

These JSON files are autogenerated by `process_network_models.ipynb`. 

Each directory will also contain a `master.py` which was created manually and combines these elements into complete networks. This semi-automatic approach was taken as there are parameters for some networks that must be manually determined due to differences between OpenDSS and Pandapower.

Most notably, the base voltage for buses, the connection to the external grid and the slack bus.
